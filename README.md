_Generating reference genome from GTF file and converting a list of probes to a list of genes & vice versa_
______

A simple method to generate mouse/human genomic references or converting microarray probs to a list of genes across genome. 
The R scripts are generated using 

- [x] _refGenome_ R package,
- [X] _Biobase_ R package and the functions therein as well as
