# Generating Reference Genome

_Generating reference genome from GTF file and converting a list of probes to a list of genes & vice versa_

A simple method to generate mouse/human genomic references or converting microarray probs to a list of genes across genome. 
The R scripts are generated using 
[x] _refGenome_ ,
[X] _Biobase_ R packages and the functions therein and  
[x] using genome wide annotation for Human from Bioconductor http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/org.Hs.eg.db.html
